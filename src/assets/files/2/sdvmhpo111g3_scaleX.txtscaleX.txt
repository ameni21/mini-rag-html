The company's mission is to empower businesses through advanced AI solutions.
Our primary tools include FastAPI, LangChain, and ChromaDB for robust backend and retrieval systems.

FastAPI is used to build high-performance web APIs with Python. It ensures fast execution and automatic docs generation.
LangChain helps developers connect LLMs with external data sources like vector databases or APIs for contextual reasoning.
ChromaDB is a lightweight, local-first vector database ideal for prototyping retrieval-based systems. It stores document embeddings and supports fast similarity search.

As of 2024, all policies are aligned with GDPR and internal ethical AI standards. This includes secure handling of personal data, transparency, and user consent mechanisms.

All team members are encouraged to document architectural decisions and technical strategies in the internal wiki. Knowledge sharing is critical to our success and innovation.

Recent projects include:
- A customer support assistant based on RAG
- A sales enablement chatbot using Web Search APIs (Tavily, Serper)
- An internal search engine powered by ChromaDB and OpenAI's GPT models

Company values: Innovation, Transparency, Privacy-first, Collaboration.
