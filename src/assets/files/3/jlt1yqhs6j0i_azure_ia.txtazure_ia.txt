Document Processing with Azure AI Samples
This repository contains a collection of code samples that demonstrate how to use various Azure AI capabilities to process documents.

The samples are intended to help engineering teams establish techniques with Azure AI Foundry, Azure OpenAI, Azure AI Document Intelligence, and Azure AI Language services to build solutions to extract structured data, classify, and analyze documents.

The techniques demonstrated take advantage of various capabilities from each service to:

Reduce complexity of custom model training by taking advantage of the capabilities of Generative AI models to analyze and classify documents.
Improve reliability in document processing by utilizing combining AI service capbilities to extract structured data from any document type, with high accuracy and confidence.
Simplify document processing workflows by providing reusable code and patterns that can be easily modified and evaluated for most use cases.
